# Re-model Flashband page

[**Flashband**](https://www.flashband-internet.com/) is a internet service provider from Argentina.

I have entered the page and it did not look good, it did not convey security, so I challenge myself to try what I learned in my university and try to do a reshaping of the page.(just to test my skills).

## This is how it looks

This designs were just to set the design i wanted to make, so in the final design i made it some changes according to what i was seeing.
